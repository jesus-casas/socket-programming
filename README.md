# Description:
 Develop a simple chat application that allows multiple users to communicate with each other over a network using sockets. Users should be able to connect to a central server and send messages to other connected users in real-time.

## Features:

- Server-side:
Create a server application that listens for incoming connections from clients.
Maintain a list of connected clients and manage communication between them.
Handle incoming messages from clients and broadcast them to all other connected clients.

- Client-side:
Create a client application that connects to the server.
Allow users to enter a username before connecting to the server.
Send messages typed by the user to the server, which will then broadcast them to all other connected clients.
Receive messages from other clients and display them in the user interface.

- User Interface:
Design a simple user interface for the client application
Display the list of connected users.
Provide a text input field for typing messages.
Display incoming messages in a chat window.

- Additional Features:
Implement basic error handling and validation for network connections.
Allow users to disconnect from the server gracefully.
Add support for private messages between users.
Implement basic security measures such as username/password authentication or encryption of messages.

## Implementation:
- Choose a Programming Language: Decide on the programming language you want to use for both the server and client applications. Python is a popular choice for socket programming due to its simplicity, but you can use any language you're comfortable with.

- Socket Programming: Learn about socket programming concepts such as TCP/IP sockets, server-client architecture, socket creation, binding, listening, accepting connections, sending and receiving data, etc.

- Implementation Steps:
Start by implementing the server application. Create a socket, bind it to a specific IP address and port, listen for incoming connections, accept connections from clients, and handle client messages.
Then, implement the client application. Create a socket, connect it to the server, send messages to the server, and receive messages from the server.
Finally, add the user interface to the client application. Design the components and integrate them with the client-side socket code.

- Testing: Test your chat application thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected. Run multiple instances of the client application to simulate multiple users connecting to the server simultaneously. Test various scenarios such as sending messages, receiving messages, connecting/disconnecting users, handling errors, etc.

- Documentation: Document your code thoroughly, including explanations of how the server and client applications work, how to run them, any dependencies, etc.
